PMOD 0 => micro SD card + adapter
PMOD 1, 2 => DVI connector

--- STEP 1: BUILD THE BOARD ---
1. CLOCK
- Add HDMI and HDMI 5x clock domain
- instantiate MMCM
    buf divide by 4 to get sys_clk
    two clocks output:
    HDMI: 25MHz
    HDMI 5x: 125MHz

2. add extension: DVI connection
- _dvi_pmod_io instantiated using 2 pmod ports
- clock domain: HDMI
- add a frame buffer
    640x480 @75Hz
    match res and freq of target. doom software has these kind of hard-coded in
